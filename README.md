# word_guess_v2
This is the second verison of the original hit "word_guessing_game" from project 3!!!

In this updated version we now have the game modes created as classes!

Give it a whirl! 

You will need to go into the file "gameFunctions.py" and change the path of the file to match your system.
This should be located on line 6 of that file.


Have fun!
